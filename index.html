<h2>Accommodations</h2>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal antidiscrimination statute that provides

reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. Moreover, the University of Arkansas Academic Policy
Series 1520.10 requires that students with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations to ensure
the
ir equal access to course content. If you have a documented disability and require accommodations,
please contact me privately at the beginning of the semester to make arrangements for necessary
classroom adjustments. Please note, you must first verify you

<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>Online writing poses a special challenge for writers as the traditional norms of print publication (and the
control they give over presentation) get tossed out the window. Texts are expected to not only make the
leap to the web successfully, but to look great across any number of devices while doing so. In many
smaller organizations, a technical writer may even find him or herself as the sole person responsible for
maintaining the entire organization's web presence. In this course, we'll tackle the challenge of writing for
online audiences by giving technical and professional writers the tools and theory they need to write
successfully online, including an understanding of HTML, CSS, Responsive Web Design, and the ways
web standards impact successful online writing. We'll also focus some on creating an organization's web
presence, and the process of maintaining editorial control over the content of such sites using standard
HTML/CSS as well as content management systems such as Drupal. </p>
<p><h2>Sandbox Site</h2>
Each week, you'll maintain a sandbox site via the university's COMP server. You'll be expected to
use this site to try out some of the techniques we'll be discussing in readings each week, and often
you'll be tasked between classes to implement a planned site feature that we've covered during our
weekly meeting. This work at times (perhaps often) will be collaborative, and will provide you a
space to freely test out ideas and push your skills in formatting content for the web.
A content
management site will eventually accompany this sandbox site when we transition to the second
half of the semester.</p>.
<p><h2>Site Critique</h2>
For our first major assignment with a due date, you'll complete a critique of an existing site. Your
critique will need to integrate our readings on visual rhetoric, usability, as well as usability testing of
the site in question.
Site Project Part 1
For the first part of your site project, you will need to propose working with a client or on your own
p
ersonal project for a website or equivalent work with HTML/CSS or a content management
system. Your initial project report will map out the stakeholders for the project, the purpose, goals,
markers for success, and a timeline for your work.</p>
<p><h2>Site Project
Part 2</h2>
The final portion of your project will be the submission of the site or equivalent work, along with a
report on the project. The report should include a summary of your project, your design choices,
your rationale for those choices, and the results
of your usability testing on the site or equivalent
project.</p>
<h2><p>Classroom Participation</br>
Github Account<h2>
As part of your participation in the course, you'll be expected to maintain a Github account (we'll go
over this early on) that will serve as a backup fo
r your HTML/CSS projects. These accounts will
also support teamwork from time to time.</p>
</h2><p>In
-
Class Team Projects</h2>
During the semester, we'll often have a team project that will serve as the focus for our application
of the week's readings. You'll work in pa
irs or threes to put together a project that makes use of
the content we've discussed in that week's readings (and previous readings) to solve a particular
problem. These projects at times will leak over into your sandbox site work.</p>
<p><h2>In
-
Class Technique Sh
aring</h2>
From time to time we'll work together to educate each other in class as to specific techniques that
we've found useful for shaping content for the web. You'll be asked from time to time to share a
particularly effective technique that you discovered
with the rest of the class in an informal fashion.</p>
<h2><p>Discussions</h2>
You'll be expected to take part in classroom discussions that will be the driving force of many of our
face
-
to
-
face meetings. Respectful participation is expected.</p>

Academic Integrity
“As a core part of its mission, the University of Arkansas provides students with the opportunity to further
their educational goals through programs of study and re
search in an environment that promotes freedom
of inquiry and academic responsibility. Accomplishing this mission is possible only when intellectual
honesty and individual integrity prevail. Each University of Arkansas student is required to be familiar w
ith,
and abide by, the University's ‘Academic Integrity Policy,' which may be found at
http://provost.uark.edu/academicintegrity/245.php
.
Students with questions about how these policies app
ly
to a particular course or assignment should immediately contact their instructor.”

Chancellor for Academic Affairs
Attendance Policy (and Late Work)
The below regarding attendance is taken directly from the faculty hand
book, located at
http://provost.uark.edu/91.php
.
University Policy
Education at the university level requires active involvement in the learning process. Therefore students
have the responsibility to attend
classes and to actively engage in all learning assignments or opportunities
provided in their classes. Instructors have the responsibility to provide a written policy on student
attendance that is tied to course objectives and included in a course syllabus
. There may be times,
however, when illness, family crisis, or university
-
sponsored activities make full attendance or participation
impossible. In these situations students are responsible for making timely arrangements with the instructor
to make up work
missed. Such arrangements should be made in writing and prior to the absence when
possible.
Examples of absences that should be considered excusable include those resulting from the following: 1)
illness of the student, 2) serious illness or death of a m
ember of the student's immediate family or other
family crisis, 3) University
-
sponsored activities for which the student's attendance is required by virtue of
scholarship or leadership/participation responsibilities, 4) religious observances (see Students'
Religious
Observances policy below), 5) jury duty or subpoena for court appearance, and 6) military duty. The
instructor has the right to require that the student provide appropriate documentation for any absence for
which the student wishes to be excused
.
Our Classroom Policy
For our purposes, attendance will be a requirement of this course, and absence from the course will
negatively impact your final grade. As this is a one a week graduate course, you should not expect to miss
more than two class perio
ds. If you miss more than two classes, I reserve the right to fail you from the
course.
Any absences that qualify as excused absences, as described above by university policy, must be reported
as excused to the instructor within one class period of your
return to class. If you are sick, I am quite happy
with you staying home and not sharing your illness with us all, but you must let me know about that
excused nature of the absence upon your return.
Late Work Policy
If you are absent on the date an assig
nment is due and you fail to turn in that assignment, it will be graded
as a
F
for 0 credit. For a major assignment, this can be catastrophic to your final grade In the course. If for
some reason you know ahead of time you will not have an assignment due o
n time, please seek an
extension from me via email or face
-
to
-
face. If you ask for an extension, you may be granted one if the
circumstances make sense. If you don't ask for an extension until after the assignment is due, the
assignment cannot be made up.
If you have work that is late and you are unable to attend due to illness or a university
-
recognized excused
absence, your work should be made up as soon as possible. It is the responsibility of students to find out
about any missed assignments: I will n
ot search you out to let you know about assignments you have
missed.
Cancellation of Class
In the event that class must be cancelled, I will notify you via Blackboard and email. I will strive to notify you
by noon on the date we will not have class.
